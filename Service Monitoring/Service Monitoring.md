## üöÄ Steps to Perform
Perform the following step by step:  

## Task 1. Deploy a test application

```bash
curl -LO raw.githubusercontent.com/ArcadeCrew/Google-Cloud-Labs/refs/heads/main/Service%20Monitoring/arcadecrew.sh

sudo chmod +x arcadecrew.sh

./arcadecrew.sh
```

## Task 2. Use Service Monitoring to create an availability SLO

1. **Navigate to Monitoring**
  - Go to **Monitoring > SLOs** from [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/slos).
2. **Define the Service**:
  - Notice that Service Monitoring already sees your default App Engine application. "If it doesn't, wait a minute, refresh the page and click `+Define a service`, select `default`, and submit it."
3. **Create SLO**:
   - Select `default` service.
   - Click **+Create SLO**.
   - Set the metric type to **`Availability`**.
   - Keep the evaluation method as **`Request-based`**.
   - Click **Continue**.
   - Define the SLO:
     - **Period type**: `Rolling`.
     - **Period length**: `7 days`.
     - **Goal**: `99.5%`.
   - Click **`Create SLO`**.
2. In your newly created SLO and click on the **`Alerts firing`** tab.
3. Click on **`CREATE SLO ALERT`**.
4. Set the following parameters:
   - **Display name**: `Really short window test`
   - **Lookback duration**: `10 minutes`
   - **Burn rate threshold**: `1.5`
5. Click **`Next`**.
6. Under **`Notification Channels`**, click **`Manage Notification Channels`**:
   - Select **`Email`** as the type.
   - Enter your `Username` as email address and give **Display Name** as `Arcade Crew`.
7. Return to the alert creation process, select the email notification channel you just created, and click **`Next`**.
8. Skip the **`Steps to fix the issue`** field and click **`Save`**.

9. Redeploy the change to App Engine
  ```bash
  gcloud app deploy
  ```

- Type `y` when prompted to confirm the deployment.
- Wait for the deployment to complete.
