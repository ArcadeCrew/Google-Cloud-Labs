## 🛠️ Looker Configuration Steps

> ✅ **NOTE:** *Watch Full Video to get Full Scores on Check My Progress.*

---

### 🎯 Task 1: Pivot dimensions

> 👇 Copy the following code and paste it into the **`faa` model** in Looker.

```lookml
# Place in `faa` model
explore: +flights {
  query: start_from_here{
      dimensions: [depart_week, distance_tiered]
      measures: [count]
      filters: [flights.depart_date: "2003"]
    }
  }
```
> 💡 **Important:** After pasting the code, carefully follow the subsequent steps for Task 1 to ensure correct implementation.

* **Title the Look**
```
Flight Count by Departure Week and Distance Tier
```

---

### 🎯 Task 2: Reorder columns and remove fields

> 👇 Copy the following code and paste it into the **`faa` model** in Looker.

```lookml
# Place in `faa` model
explore: +flights {
  query: start_from_here{
      dimensions: [aircraft_origin.state]
      measures: [percent_cancelled]
      filters: [flights.depart_date: "2000"]
    }
  }
```
> 💡 **Important:** After pasting the code, carefully follow the subsequent steps for Task 2 to ensure correct implementation.

* **Title the Look**
```
Percent of Flights Cancelled by State in 2000
```

---

### 🎯 Task 3: Use table calculations to calculate simple percentages

> 👇 Copy the following code and paste it into the **`faa` model** in Looker.

```lookml
# Place in `faa` model
explore: +flights {
    query: start_from_here{
      dimensions: [aircraft_origin.state]
      measures: [cancelled_count, count]
      filters: [flights.depart_date: "2004"]
    }
}
```
> 💡 **Important:** After pasting the code, carefully follow the subsequent steps for Task 3 to ensure correct implementation.

* In the **Expression field**, add the following Table Calculation:
```
${flights.cancelled_count}/${flights.count}
```

* **Title the Look**
```
Percent of Flights Cancelled by Aircraft Origin 2004
```

---

### 🎯 Task 4: Use table calculations to calculate percentages of a total

> 👇 Copy the following code and paste it into the **`faa` model** in Looker.

```lookml
# Place in `faa` model
explore: +flights {
    query: start_from_here{
      dimensions: [carriers.name]
      measures: [total_distance]
    }
}
```
> 💡 **Important:** After pasting the code, carefully follow the subsequent steps for Task 4 to ensure correct implementation.

* Add the following in **Expression field**:
```
${flights.total_distance}/${flights.total_distance:total}
```

* **Title the Look:**
```
Percent of Total Distance Flown by Carrier
```

---

### 🎯 Task 5: Use functions in table calculations

> 👇 Copy the following code and paste it into the **`faa` model** in Looker.

```lookml
# Place in `faa` model
explore: +flights {
    query:start_from_here {
      dimensions: [depart_year, distance_tiered]
      measures: [count]
      filters: [flights.depart_date: "after 2000/01/01"]
    }
}
```
> 💡 **Important:** After pasting the code, carefully follow the subsequent steps for Task 5 to ensure correct implementation.

* Add the following **Table Calculation**, making use of the `pivot_offset` function:
```
(${flights.count}-pivot_offset(${flights.count}, -1))/pivot_offset(${flights.count}, -1)
```

* Title the Look:
```
YoY Percent Change in Flights flown by Distance, 2000-Present
```
